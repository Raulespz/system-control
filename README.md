# system-control
Task 1: Simulate the system without applying control, starting with the given initial conditions. Task 2: Simulate the system with the VS/SM control system using PID error metrics. The simulation generates various plots, including nominal and realized trajectories, tracking errors, phase spaces, and control signals.
